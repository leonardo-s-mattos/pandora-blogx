<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it:</h2>

<p>A working agreement is a critical artifact for agile and high performing teams.
It makes explicit the values, principles, practices, and behaviors of a team.
It‚Äôs a living and breathing document, that evolves as the team learns, grows,
and attempts to drive out ambiguity. It‚Äôs immensely useful for introducing new
team members so they quickly understand the norms of a team. It can be used to help
define team empowerment, interactions with other teams, and many other
situational events. In short, it‚Äôs a social contract and provides a foundation
for a true team.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-it">When to use it:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hiring or Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Building and maintain
this working agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stable team updating as new information is learned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review the working agreement with new team members.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A team using working agreement has clear agreement on explicit values,
principles, practices, and norms in behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A team explicitly discusses tough situations and develops an agreement on
how to proceed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-execute-it">How to execute it:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Recommend Initial Time: Depends but a minimum of 4 hours. For example, when
our team created our initial working agreement (brand new team working
globally), it took the better part of a week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommended update: Ad-hoc, but new agreements driven out of retrospectives
should update the working agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Difficulty level: 3/5</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="working-agreement-play">Working Agreement play</h3>

<p>There are many resources on how to write a good working agreement, however the
key is that they range across the whole spectrum of topics from strategic, such as
the team‚Äôs identity, charter, vision all the way down to operational aspects,
such as logistics of scrum events (day/time/place), or how people notify each
other that they are out of the office.</p>

<p>The most effective working agreements are ones that eliminate ambiguity in
situations that would normally cause delay in decision making, information flow,
typical situations of conflict and friction, and how the team interacts on a day
to day basis and achieves team consensus on the working condition that is
optimal for the health of the entire team.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-working-agreement-play">Creating a working agreement play</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Setup an initial block of time (suggested 1-3 hours) to determine elements
to cover in a working agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this time, one way to build a working agreement is for the team to
define what is important to them, brainstorm on that topic, using the
question: ‚ÄúWe work best when‚Äù, and come to a consensus on the most important
topics. This often works for smaller chunks of time, however the risk is
that teams tend to think about rosy situations versus ones with friction and
conflict.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another method is to ask relevant questions to facilitate your working agreement. Some questions might include:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Who we are and what do we do? What does success look like?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Who is our Customer, and how do we serve them? How do we define our
Product?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do we set our priority?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do we deal with HR issues?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What values do we believe in? How do we improve?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do we hold each other accountable?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What are our roles and responsibilities?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do we do work? (Agile/Scrum/Kanban?) How do we intake, do, track,
and finish work?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What logistics support our work? What is our operational model? What
does a day on the team look like?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What tools do we use?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do we scale?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do we work with other teams?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What happens when we fail?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do we celebrate success?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What are our metrics?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do we handle remote/global teams?</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement should receive a consensus of the team, which could be done by
voting or another group decision making process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responses to these questions should be captured in a living and
breathing document. We recommend that this document be easily accessible and
editable in a collaborative manner. We‚Äôve embedded ours as a wiki within
Microsoft Teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once these areas have been discussed, the team should formally sign the
agreement and celebrate. It‚Äôs quite the milestone to agree on how the team
should work together.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="updating-a-working-agreement-play">Updating a working agreement play</h3>

<p>A working agreement should be updated whenever relevant new information that
could change the future behavior and norms of a team. Updates can be based off a
real situation, such as a recent source of disagreement or ambiguity.</p>

<p>As your team conducts retrospectives, it‚Äôs often wise to review if the actions
out of the retrospective drive updates to the working agreement. It should
require the same steps on open discussion, consensus, and final agreement and
commitment.</p>

<h3 id="on-boarding-a-new-team-member">On-boarding a new team member</h3>

<p>A working agreement should be immediately reviewed when a new team member joins
the team. If the new team member has questions that the team hasn‚Äôt previously
considered, the agreement should be updated to reflect the changes.</p>
