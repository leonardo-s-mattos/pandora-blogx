<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it:</h2>

<p>In the world of agile, we know that Individuals and interactions are valued over
processes and tools, but we also know that dealing with other humans is always
messier than going at it alone. We also know that truly complex software can‚Äôt
be built by a single individual, and that it is extremely satisfying to share
the journey in solving a complex problem together with an engaged team. Humans
are also typically pre-disposed to making human connections and social
interactions, and tend have higher happiness when experiencing greater social
connections, but what truly makes a high-performing team, and how does one know?
In this play below, we provide a framework for providing constructive feedback
towards joint problem-solving.</p>

<p><strong>The content in this play is based on content derived from Hugh Keelan course
on providing feedback at Stanford‚Äôs Graduate School of Business.</strong></p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-it">When to use it:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Consistently using supportive
confrontation and embedded within the team culture creates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any team in need of improvement with clear dysfunctions. Applying these
techniques can lead to joint problem solving.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team that has a lot of ‚ÄúI‚Äôs.‚Äù Applying these play helps provide open,
transparent, and builds trust, which are key for aligning towards the team‚Äôs
goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team with lower than SAP IT average westrum culture scores. Applying this
play helps create a framework for better dialog around joint problems.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes:</h2>

<p>A team that is using open dialog and supportive confrontation effectively will
exhibit the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team approach all of their interactions with each other with
<strong>kindness, consideration, empathy and respect</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team will exhibit a high degree of collaboration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team will consistently use supportive confrontation
techniques.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team will collaborate more closely and shower higher
engagement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The team will be aligned towards their goals and achieve higher productivity
and happiness.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pro tip: As Mark Twain said, go to ‚ÄúHeaven for the Climate, but Hell for the
  company.‚Äù Talking, listening with respect and empathy, and using supportive
  confrontation is the basis for a human to human connection and
  collaboration. We need real conversations to solve our most complex issues
  and leverage power of group diversity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-execute-it">How to execute it:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Recommend Initial Time: 60-minute reading and role-playing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommended Update: Practice as often as you can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Difficult level 4/5 to do consistently as a team.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Dealing with other humans is messy! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/03/douglas-adams-42-hitchhiker?INTCMP=SRCH">It‚Äôs not like calculating the answer of
42</a>,
We get it! However, we can‚Äôt just ignore the messiness of real human
interactions, so we must be equipped with tools to make it a bit less
unpleasant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pro tip: Constructive Feedback is always a gift.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider the pictures below of the three realities, courtesy of Hugh Keelan from
Stanford GSB. Person B has his needs, motives and situation (or basically what
is in his mind. Person B behaves and interacts with Person A through behavior,
actions, words. Person A is impacted by those behavior, actions and words, and
in her reality, has feelings, reactions and responses.</p>

<p><img src="./images/3realities.jpg" alt="Realtities" /></p>

<p>While each person is an expert in his or her own reality, each can never
actually know the other‚Äôs <em>INTENT</em> or <em>IMPACT</em> of the shared reality and should
<strong>NEVER</strong> make assumptions when giving their feedback. As one starts to assume
the intent or impact, you begin to venture outside of your expertise into the
realm of another. How can I argue with how you feel about something? I really
have no way, but what I can do is start to talk about our shared reality and how
we can move forward. It will also immediately put the person on the defensive,
which will also lead to the fight-or-flight core portion of the brain, and where
any logical thought and discussion will be</p>

<p>With a shared goal of moving towards joint problem solving, constructive
feedback from both parties requires one to stick within the realm of fact, which
is within their reality and what they observe in the shared reality, never
venturing into the other person‚Äôs reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pro tip: When we talk about empathy, we are just trying to understand and
  share the other person‚Äôs reality from their perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here is the technique for having constructive dialogs: <em>Use this:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>When you _<strong>__</strong><em>_ (behavior), I feel _</em><strong>__</strong>______ (insert feeling)</li>
</ul>

<p>NOT this</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you _<strong>__</strong><em>_ (behavior) I feel that _</em><strong>__</strong>___ (= attribution;
imputed motive)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The second sentence should not be used as it moves towards stepping into
someone else‚Äôs reality. Speaking from everyone‚Äôs own reality, helps build a
trust level that hopefully gets you on the way to a joint problem solving, and
remember, hidden problems fester!</em></p>

<p>When having these conversations, some tips are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Listen. No, I mean really, listen, not just waiting for your turn to respond
to the thought you have in your head.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practice
<a href="https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/">mindfulness</a>,
and in particular, observe how you feel about things in the present moment,
let your judgements roll by, and return to the present state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use empathy, really try to understand the perspective of the other by
putting yourself in their shoes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Pro tip: One great technique if you have time to plan before your
  conversation is to role-play the specific scenario with a neutral third
  party, however you should role-play the person you are expecting to have
  a supportive confrontation with, and the third party should role-play
  you. You will likely develop new insights having to role-play outside of
  yourself.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat your understanding of what the person said before you respond.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For advanced level discussions, a variety of other feedback techniques may be
used.</p>

<h4 id="running-the-basic-supportive-confrontation-practice-role-play">Running the basic supportive confrontation practice role play:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find a partner or a few partners on your team who you are willing to
role-play with you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose a recent scenario where you provided feedback that didn‚Äôt go as
planned, or an upcoming scenario where you plan to provide feedback.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain the context of the scenario to the role-play partner. Stay within
the shared reality of the situation (e.g. try not to explain your intent or
how you felt).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Utilize the technique:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>When you _<strong>__</strong><em>_ (behavior), I feel _</em><strong>__</strong>______ (insert
feeling)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some additional variations include (in level of ratcheting up the levels)

</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>This is the effect of your _<strong>__</strong><em>__</em>_ behavior on me, such as the
statement, ‚ÄúI feel patronized and controlled when you interrupt‚Äù.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your _<strong>___ behavior is not meeting your apparent goals or intentions,
such as, ‚ÄúYou are making it difficult for us to explore the issue to the
extent that we must in order to _</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>_ (stated goal). I don‚Äôt think
that is the effect you want. Was this the _</strong><strong>__</strong>__ (stated goal) you
are trying to achieve?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your _<strong>__</strong>_ behavior may meet your goals, but it is very costly to you.
For example, ‚ÄúYour _______ behavior may make you win this decision, but if
you haven‚Äôt noticed, it seems like myself and others on the team are less
willing to express their views‚Äù. Note that this approach can be dangerous as
it starts to get into realities of others as you discuss the costs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúIn what ways am I part of the problem?‚Äù In this variation, you state the
situation in which you are part of the problem. For example, ‚ÄúIt seems like
every time we discuss _<strong>__</strong>_ (topic), we fall into a negative cycle and
I find myself becoming defensive when I anticipate your response. This makes
me tense and dig in on my points. That must make you frustrated as well. Can
we discuss?‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>See how the conversation goes, you may want to practice it a few ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Optional, but commended) Switch the roles, now you should play the person
receiving the feedback. This will likely give you some additional insight</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="running-the-basic-supportive-confrontation-problem-solving-and-commitment-play">Running the basic supportive confrontation problem solving and commitment play:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Utilize the supportive confrontation that you practiced.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Reticence or not resolving the issue will lead to larger problems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Resist the urge to attack.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Position Power doesn‚Äôt matter.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Begin to jointly problem solve and achieve commitment:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>First, address the behaviors, with the clear assumption that both sides
have the best intentions, and aligned team goals in mind. You don‚Äôt need
a single reality, knowing that there is a Reality for person A, a
Reality for person B, and a shared reality.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Try to gain agreement on mutually acceptable behaviors, and what
specifically would change. For example, ‚ÄúWhenever we are in a
brainstorming session, we will not interrupt until a person has finished
speaking.‚Äù This can also be put into a working agreement if the team
decides it applies.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Be aware of the statement, ‚ÄúI am what I am.‚Äù Personality may not
change, but behavior in the shared reality is controllable.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Be wary of the desire to end the conflict quickly via generic
platitudes, such as ‚ÄúI promise to be more considerate‚Äù versus, ‚Äúin
our next meeting, please signal me by raising your hand, and I‚Äôll
remember to include you and others in the conversation by not
interrupting.‚Äù</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once you can have open discussions, you can begin to jointly talk about
the issues without the context of behaviors. It may be worthwhile to
have a joint discussion and be open and transparent on the goals and
concerns.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once all sides have presented their opinions, remember to commit to the
consensus, even if it‚Äôs not specifically the outcome you wanted to
achieve. Do not let decisions linger without action steps.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Check-in frequently to ensure the commitment is there. Reinforce welcome
behaviors, provide feedback on regressions.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
