<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it:</h2>

<p>It’s well known that as individuals, we love to feel valued. It improves our
confidence, our morale and in all honesty, puts a smile on our face even if we
dont show it!</p>

<p>Getting appreciation at the end of a Demo or a release gives you a good feeling
about the Product you are working on, but what about <strong>how</strong> you are working on
something, or what you do for the Team (your peers).</p>

<p>This simple play is designed to increase the cross-team confidence and
appreciation while underlining the need to be engaged with your Team and
understand what each other is working on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Pro tip</em>: It is important to let the Team know that this play is coming as
  they may need to adapt their behavior ahead of time to have content as we’ll<br />
  outline later in this play. Suggested reminder 2 weeks, 1 week and 3 days
  before use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="when-to-use-it">When to use it:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Going through a cycle of
Confidence &amp; Appreciation will focus the Team on each other’s activities and
behaviors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stable team in need of increased cross-team engagement. Applying this play
will give a renewed appreciation for the work the team does</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team that has a lot of “I’s.” Applying this play helps support an interest
in transparency, understanding and respect.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes:</h2>

<p>A team that is using Confidence &amp; Appreciation effectively will exhibit the
following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team show a general interest in what each other are working
on and recognizes the efforts of colleagues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team go the extra mile to gain the recognition and respect of
their colleagues when the play is happening</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team will consciously and proactively be attentive to the
updates of others in the daily stand up and seek to understand how and what
they are doing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The team will show in increased amount of peer work (reviews, coding,
testing, designing)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team will show in increased appetite for going outside of
their “traditional” role to help other Team members</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team will show additional motivation through getting
recognition and appreciation from each and every one of their colleagues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team will avoid being the team member who has no praise for
their colleagues, actively seeking out positive things to say about their
colleagues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the team will be conscious their colleagues are looking out for
each other with a view to giving praise and recognition which will in turn
lead to an increased focus on the goal</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Pro tip:</em> The absolute aim is to ensure every Team member has something
  positive and encouraging to say about each of their peers. Every effort
  should be made to encourage the team to do this.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Willingness to go beyond the norm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Healthy competition</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Running the Confidence &amp; Appreciation play:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Set expectations with the Team: As this play is built upon the
<strong>Appreciation</strong> that each Team member shows for each other it is necessary
to ensure the Team members behave in the manner that we are looking for
<em>ahead</em> of the 1st session.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Team should be asked to vote on the use of this play with the question
as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Would you be interested in running a play with your Team on Confidence
and Appreciation, so you get the chance to recognize your colleagues at
the end of each sprint for 3 sprints?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Answer should be simply Yes/No. You can use Qualtrics, or Slack (Polly)
or whatever format suits the needs of the Team. Anonymous or not</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming the vote passes with a “Yes” majority:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Scrum Master solicits feedback to set a date for the play (at least 2
weeks away to get a chance for the Team to observe each other and have
content to be appreciative for). It is recommended to start off the next
Team retro with this play, but it could also be used as an icebreaker for
another event</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Scrum Master outlines what will be done in this play which is:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Each Team member will be encouraged to Appreciate all other Team members
1 by 1 (including the PO and SM). Some examples of an appreciation
statement might be:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>I appreciate the detailed feedback on the peer review we did
together</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I think the demo you performed was clear and concise</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I like how patient you were when you talked me through the code</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The User Story you put together was so sharp and concise it was easy
to deliver</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>That was a great idea you came up with on how to deliver the
requirement</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Team goes through 1 entire cycle so that everyone has provided
appreciation of everyone else</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Scrum Master asks for observations of the feedback received (discussion)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Scrum Master elaborates on the feedback received to reiterate the
positive points in the play. “I really liked that we….”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Scrum Master asks for feedback on the approach to see if it was
worthwhile “Did we feel that this exercise was a positive one that we’d like
to continue?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Scrum Master proposes the next occurrence for the play at the next
instance of the Retro (or whatever meeting it is).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Scrum Master closes the play</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Possible next steps to the Confidence &amp; Appreciation play:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes the Team members may not be able to come up with anything to say,
in which case, the Scrum Master is encouraged to support the Team by
understanding the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>No visibility to other Team members activities:</strong></p>

        <ul>
