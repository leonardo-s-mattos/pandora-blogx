There have being a heavy usage of word "transformation" now a days. And a lot of people in the tranches, trying to "transform" big elephants to "unicorn" like entities.

We are facing a lot of "business oriented" senior leadership, very few aligned with engineering mindset and willing to out of blue throw money at "organizational change efforts". And on top of it, we see organizations drowning into project-base culture, in which people just work on stuff that are part of a project and they just have time to work on project related items.

 So, it's common to hear : I know you asking me or us to change this behavior, be more agile or pay attention to flow and throughput but I cannot do it as its not part of the project. If you want this to be done, you have to put this into a project. It's agile, DevOps, Digital, Cloud…. Way too many asks at the same time.

 And then, with this, I have seeing and heard ( and I will not lie to you, I have tried this as well ) to create "projects" to implement change somehow, being implementing testing automation, managing better backlog, training teams, developing scrum masters, building pipelines, etc…. Many different isolated projects or initiatives or even combined efforts, with great intentions, but the wrong focus and without really buy in of many people and for sure not from "top of the house".

Doing a full retrospective in all initiatives and effort and also looking for references out there, I was presented with the idea of "Organization Change Management". With the concept of building strategy to manage the buy in and results of the changes with the usage of data, either being metrics, results or savings to realized value of return of the investment, in all levels.

To simplify it, its involving the teams in the change or transformation efforts and thinking process, embedding the change on their real work and what matter most for them. Its run the transformation with empowered teams and individuals to experiment and dictate where and when to change. It's involving the senior leadership and C-level with actual numbers and results from the effort, constantly ( there is the impact of the Value Stream Management efforts ). 

To effective manage anything, it’s a basic concept that you need to be able to see. Its same thing with organizational change.

For the whole organization, but specially for C-suite sponsorship, introduce the full value stream management concept, merging it with improvement kata, will help with the engagement of business and will bring money and priority. This is not magic. Its science. You using the improvement cycles to align goals, define directives and policies and showing the progress towards those goals will bring the whole organization into it. This, combined with conduct stakeholder impact analysis, actively engage your partners and commit to a partnership will make business sponsors understand the reasons, needs and benefits of change. They will see the numbers!!

Important strategies to engage teams and people be visible is around a community. With a sense of community, people feel more comfortable to express themselves and experiment and learn from each other. Ideas for it, from things I have tried with success have being creating "open spaces" where people can talk about what they think is more relevant to them around the topics presented by the change effort. Examples of "Open spaces" are : "Office hours" and "Lean coffee sessions" that can be managed regularly. But don’t be limited to this examples. Any community meetings style will help and you can experiment what works better for your organization.

Together with building communities, you need to let everyone know of what you doing and the results from the teams. Few ideas to do it are : regular demos of practices and principles, "lunch & learn" sessions, Internal Conferences, Office Hours and Roadshows, where you show case your change effort results and recognize effort from the teams.

And finally, one more important aspect of change management is building continuous learning culture through experiment and trainings. On the experiments, its important to foster certain percentage of time for innovate and be "silly". One of my favorite examples are doing regularly ( I like to do 1 day each quarter) internal Hackathons and also, organizational level retrospective or review of value stream mapping. 

To close this, I will leave you with the message to do your pre work, use metrics and assessment to evaluate if your organization is ready for change, tackle the areas that need training and once ready, design your organization change management strategy.

Let me know how that went to you. If you want more details on my experience, just shoot me some messages and lets talk.
