### Mindfulness play:

**Optional:** Read and practice the basics based on [this
site](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) (30 – 90
minutes)

**Putting it into practice on a frequent basis, but keep these tips in mind:**

1.  **Try to be present, and observe the moment for what it is, and how it
    impacts you.**

2.  **When your mind wanders during a conversation, try to gently bring it back,
    and focus on observing the present moment. Observe your reactions without
    judgement. To stay within the present in a conversation, reflect back what
    is said (both in words and body language).**
