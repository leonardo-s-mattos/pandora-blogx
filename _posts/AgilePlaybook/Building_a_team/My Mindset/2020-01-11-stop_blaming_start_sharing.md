Play: Building a high-performing team: AVOIDING THE BLAME GAME IN HEALTHY TEAMS
===============================================================================

What is it:
-----------

It is no secret that sometimes things won't go as planned. In some cases, we
feel badly about the results and often it may impact us in challenging ways.
Another concerning attribute with unexpected outcomes is that often in the
post-mortem analysis the finger gets pointed at someone or something. For most
of us, we don't want to be blamed for anything that has potential consequences
and so in a team environment blaming seems to tear at the fabric of the team's
willingness to experiment and innovate. Unfortunately, it happens more than we
care to admit, and it must be avoided at nearly all costs to foster a
high-performance team.

>   Pro tip: One of the key differences in blaming and establishing post-mortem
>   analysis to prevent repeating problems is that blaming makes someone “wrong”
>   versus having people know that the inquiry into how something happened is
>   based on correcting it and helping them avoid the issue in the future.
>   Psychological safety, a key ingredient to high performing teams requires
>   teams to adopt the right mindset and avoid blaming individuals in failure
>   scenarios.

When to use it:
---------------

-   At all times with all teams, in all stages of capability and maturity
    levels.

-   When part of the process fails to produce a timely and functioning result as
    expected.

-   If in any situation there is dissension amongst the team and in the effort
    to determine why there is a stall in the growth or movement any one person
    might be responsible for the issues.

-   Newly formed teams (Norming / Performing stages). Consistently applying the
    principal of sharing versus blaming keeps the pipelines of communication
    open.

-   Teams that have a lot of “you’s” in their language patterns. Using this play
    offers the team a chance to openly engage in an “us” based conversation that
    is often open, honest and transparent. An “us” conversation helps build
    trust, and allows for the engagement of solving conflicts; creating more
    alignment towards true team achievement.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

A team that values accountability, trust and the avoidance of blame in most
cases will exhibit the following characteristics:

-   Members of the team interact with each other by accepting that things will
    sometimes go awry.

-   Members approach each other with empathy knowing that in any given situation
    they too may make a mistake and must be accountable to the team.

-   The team will exhibit a sense of shared responsibility over isolating anyone
    for any reason.

-   Members of the team will examine their own deficiencies, insensitivities and
    rigidity as well as their teammates without provoking anyone’s defenses at
    the same time.

-   Members of the team will recognize situations that create team dysfunctions.

-   The team will be aligned in gestalt manner where the goals of the team are
    far greater than the sum of its members goals.

>   confrontation without creating negative feelings and an undue focus on
>   mistakes and needed corrections. Remember, a bad system always defeats a
>   good person.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Consider using the NASA (National Aeronautical Space Administration -USA]
    famous line to setup the acknowledgement; “Houston WE have a problem.” Using
    this term helps as it preconditions the team to immediately focus on problem
    versus defensiveness. It should also reinforce that it’s the process or
    system that has the process, versus the individual.

-   Define the problem in detail without using names, pronouns (you, he, she).
    Ensure there is consensus and alignment on the problem before proceeding. Be
    wary of a jump to “a solution” where we blame an individual. A team must be
    able to explain what actions and decisions they took without fear of
    punishment or tetribution.

-   Use the recommended agenda (below) for reviewing the key timeline, the
    actions and driving assumptions, the expectations of those actions, the real
    effects of those actions, and the validation of those assumptions for better
    or worse.

Recommended agenda of conducting a blameless post-mortem.

-   Ensure everyone buys into the concept of a blameless post mortem. Everyone
    MUST assume each individual acted with the best of intentions given what was
    known at the time.

-   In a brainstorming tool (physical or virtual whiteboard), outline all the
    key events in a timeline fashion to create a common understanding. This
    includes

    -   All key events.

    -   All decisions/reactions made to those events.

    -   The assumption and expectation of the that decision/action.

    -   The effects of those decisions/reactions (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
        effects)

    -   A review of the effects against the decision/actions.

-   Then proceed to ask for actionable ideas with all team members involved.

-   Once a solution is created, accepted and consensus is reached, ASK: How can
    we avoid this in the future?” This should be incorporated into the backlogs.

-   After the alternative path for solutioning is created, and the post-mortem
    analysis is around behavior on a team or individuals, use the parallel play:
    [Creating honest discussions and Supportive
    confrontation](../Interacting/2020-01-04-Creating_honest_discussions.md)
    (for a post group discussion with specific individual[s]).

-   Recommend Initial Time: 30-minutes with group and 10 minutes with any
    individual

-   For tracking: If you use this play, please copy this as a User Story into
    your execution backlog: **“ADCC Play: Building a high-performing team:
    Post-mortem Analysis”** as the title and label the jira issue:
    **“ADCC_Play”** The rest can be blank.

-   **Difficulty level: 3/5**

### Avoiding the Blame Game Play

Before using the avoiding the blame game play, an important parallel play is how
to deal with [failure, as found
here](./2020-01-07-failure.md).

Below, we will help define how to notice blaming and where it begins, some
countermeasures, and how to create a blameless environment.

#### Blaming Characteristics and The Dysfunctions it Creates

When a process is forgotten, mis-coded, done out of sequence, or simply
neglected, and an expected outcome does not occur, it is glaring and noticeable.
It’s easy to ask “what happened?” and the natural tendency is to look for a
person who was responsible for something and with whom lies the responsibility
of commission (doing something) or omission (not doing something).

We typically seek answers via the question; “Who did it?“ This is usually the
first sign that blame is being proposed as a pseudo solution. The second sign of
blame is the thought “I didn’t do it”, or “not me.” [both behaviors must be
driven from our team’s cultures as they are unproductive and tear the true
fabric of teams apart.] This also speaks to a fundamental emotion behind blame.
Blame is often the replacement of another feeling. This is explored in greater
depth in this play around
[failure](./2020-01-07-failure.md).

Blaming leads to: Isolation, Fear, Distrust, Skepticism and Reduced Quality and
Efficiency. In comparison, inquiry into the failure with a systems mindset
should be used. Better questions such as:

-   How do we create a system that is more resilient and tolerant of error?

-   What parts of the process could lead this this failure?

There is a
[story](http://nautil.us/blog/the-tricks-used-by-pilots-surgeons--engineers-to-overcome-human-error)
about B-17 bombers in WWII where when pilots were landing, some would
inextricably raise the landing gear and crash. The pilots were given additional
training, checklists, and put on aptitude tests to kick-out pilots who were
likely to cause failure. At essence, this is a result the blaming problem, or by
paraphrasing, “Once we either remove or correct the bad humans, the system will
work.”

However, a psychologist looking at the problem realized that the flaps and
landing gear controls were identical and next to each other. In the stress of a
landing situation, it was easy to grab the wrong level and raise them. He made a
slight “UX” adjustment to the system, he added a small rubber wheel to the
landing gear control, and a hard wedge to the flap control. Pilots could feel
immediately the right level, and without any additional training, aptitude
tests, or check-lists, the problem was resolved. To avoid blame, we should first
ask, what is it about the system that is causing failures? We must start with
the mindset that the entire team has the best intentions, and try to improve the
overall system.

However, In some cases, we may ultimately conclude that there is indifferent,
selfish, unwilling, and ego-centric member of the team, who cares less about
their team impact and performance; one who is consistently repeating similar
issues without regard of the impact to the team. In this case, the [listening
with
empathy](./2020-01-09-listening_with_empathy.md)
and [creating honest discussions play should be
used](../Interacting/2020-01-04-Creating_honest_discussions.md),
and if that is not successful, alternate solutions may be necessary if there is
no possibility of joint problem solving.

#### High-performing characteristics that move away from dysfunction

At the core, the team should ensure they are functioning as a team with the
correct characteristics. These are reflected in the team
[healthcheck](../The%20Team/2020-02-01-TeamHealthCheck.md)
play and are summarize as:

1.  Instead of an absence of trust, members are comfortable innovating and
    taking risks with new technology and find it effortless to admit mistakes
    and limitations. The [novelty and
    curiosity](./2020-01-10-novelty_curosity.md)
    play should be used. If the team would like to measure this specifically,
    the [team culture
    play](../The%20Team/2020-02-02-TeamCulture.md)
    can be used to assess the culture and develop tactics to improve it.

2.  Instead of a fear of conflict, team members have no fear of retribution or
    being blamed and willingly admit that they may have erred in their efforts.
    The previously mentioned creating honest discussions play is useful.

3.  The accountability stakes remain high because of the support they feel they
    will receive even if they have made an error.

4.  Attention to results is a critical element on teams where there is no blame.
    Team members want to see the results of tests so they know whether what they
    have done is good for the teams products.

In addition, the team can use various critical thinking techniques, systems
thinking and modeling, Six Sigma or other total quality management techniques to
determine probable causes and countermeasures to have corrective actions taken.
Within a sprint retro, and by adopting a continuous learning and improvement
culture, we can incrementally improve the process and system in small pieces.

In the culture we are trying to create, with the mindset that along with
innovation and experimentation comes many failures, but that these failures are
the opportunities for us to learn and improve the system overall.

Finally, while this play has mainly been about team interactions, Individuals
will also have to deal with how they internalize
[failure](./2020-01-07-failure.md)
and adopt a
[growth](./2020-01-08-Growthmindset.md)
mindset.

Pro-tip: Ideally, this play should be practiced with the team. Never wait to
have to use this play as it might come across as a crude patronizing act. Try it
in a group meeting and or retrospective as a role-play. A role-play can be a fun
way of acting out of character.
