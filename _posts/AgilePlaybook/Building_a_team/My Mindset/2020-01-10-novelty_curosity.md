Play: Building a high-performing team: Novelty and Curiosity
============================================================

What is it:
-----------

One paraphrased quote I’ve heard about devops is "not to be amazed by the height of 
high-flying companies out there, but to be amazed at the rate of their climb."
A culture of continuous improvements depends on a learning culture, where we
apply the scientific method, or basically the Plan-Do-Check-Act routine, with
both successful and unsuccessful experiments helping us improve. This play helps 
to enhance curiosity and novelty, both parts of the exploratory behavior;
which is a key component and [cornerstone] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123747143000148)
for group creativity, team innovation and the aforementioned learning culture.

An intriguing story was Google’s recruiting techniques to search for curious
individuals. In the early 2000s, google [placed a
billboard](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3916173) by a
highway with a puzzle on it ({first 10-digit prime found in consecutive digits
of e}.com). People who solved the puzzle were led to a job recruitment site.
That is how focused Google was on finding curious and intelligent individuals.
Another amazing story on the power of curiosity is captured in this
[article](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2018/10/the-power-of-curiosity.html), which
notes a story that at a manufacturer, the team noticed that an employee was
often see taking large quantities of iron and other materials home with him. The
team spoke to the CEO and said, “you need to fire this thief”. Instead, the CEO
set up a meeting with the worker, and at the end of the meeting promoted him.
Why? Well he basically discovered the worker didn’t have enough time to
experiment at work, and so outside of work, he had been developing a new product
for the company. Once put into production, it turned out to be one of the
companies most successful products. This is a great example of both curiosity
and novelty by both the worker and the CEO but it starts with being in the right
mindset and in a culture of exploration.

This play refers to the guardrails:

-   [Team Collaboration, Culture and
    Mindset](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/agiletrans/Team+collaboration%2C+culture+and+mindset)

When to use it:
---------------

-   At all times with all teams, in all stages of capability and maturity
    levels.

>   Pro tip: Novelty and curiosity will result in many failures and is
>   fundamentally messy with many outcomes leading to no benefit. You may also
>   want to refer to plays on failure and culture.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   An individual and team with that use exploratory behaviors increases their
    abilities to constantly learn and improve.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Recommend Time: 30 minutes to 1.5 hours to internalize the concept and
    techniques

-   Recommended update: Practice as frequently as possible

### Curiosity and Novelty play:

Developing curiosity and novelty cannot be done via a single specific method,
however, there are some tools that can be helpful. I’d highly recommend you read the
series of blogs posts by SAP IT’s own Martin Springer on an [innovation
culture.](https://jam4.sapjam.com/blogs/show/JNZcmVrVXTEBQZQrkk2aqh?_lightbox=true)

In addition, these techniques may prove to be helpful from a tactical
perspective in cases where we are stymied by passion or emotion:

    *on successmap including:*

    -   The “5 Whys”

    -   The “7 So whats”

Also, another way change the tone of the conversation quickly, is when you have
an objection to something, instead of saying [“Yes or Not, but”, use the “Yes,
and” phrase.](https://www.td.org/insights/leadership-improv-use-yes-and-never-yes-but)

Finally, a play that can be used within a group setting is called the curiosity
square, as [attributed](https://agileforall.com/agile-superpowers-being-agile/)
to Jake Calabrese. The setup goes like this:

1.  For a group meeting, such as a lessons learned or facilitated problem
    solving session.

2.  Team members initially write down their issues and complaints.

3.  The facilitator physically tapes up a square on the floor.

4.  Each member first reads the issue they wrote down (but doesn’t share it).
    They then step into the square and re-phrase the same statement, but in the
    manner coming from pure curiosity.

    1.  For example:

        1.  Written statement – We aren’t making our sprint commitment, and it’s
            Person XYZ’s fault because they are never available to talk.

        2.  Re-phrased statement spoken when inside curiosity box: I’ve noticed
            we missed our sprint commitment. I’ve also noticed I often have to
            depend on Person XYZ. Are those correlated? What should we do about
            it?

5.  The team can then discuss the issues, also using curiosity as the driving
    factor to better understand, emphasize, and jointly problem solve.
