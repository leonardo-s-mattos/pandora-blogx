Play: Building a high-performing team: Listening with Empathy
=============================================================

What is it:
-----------

A leadership parable asks, "...as a leader, would you rather be the hippo or the
elephant?" One has a big mouth and tiny ears and the other has big ears, and
translated, it means there are leaders that talk and those that listen. In
empowered high performing teams, we value the leaders that listen and not the
“hippos” (and this also goes for the other hippos or the highest paid person’s
opinion as well).

How can one become an elephant-style leader? In this play we give you some
techniques to listen with empathy and create new learning opportunities for
yourself as well as create a culture of a higher performing team, including
increased trust, influence, psychological safety, and general openness with a
sharing of ideas.

### Listening with empathy play:

1.  Watch this [TED
    talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation?language=en)
    by Celeste Headlee

2.  Look at this quote from Steven Covey, "Most people do not listen with the
    intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply." ([habit 5 of
    the 7 habits of highly effective
    people)](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5.html)

3.  Consider and respond to these questions to help develop one’s own listening
    skills. In a document, write out some responses to areas you feel like you
    need improvement in:

    1.  When listening, does my mind jump to a response? Does the speaker have
        my undivided attention (Note: using the [mindfulness
        play](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/IT-Agile-DevOps-CC/Playbooks/blob/master/AgilePlaybook/Building_a_team/My%20Mindset/Mindfulness.md)
        is useful here)

    2.  Do I dedicate enough time to be fully present to the conversation?

    3.  Do I consider what the other person may be feeling?

    4.  Do I reflect what I’m hearing through verbal and non-verbal cues?

    5.  Do I summarize/confirm with the speaker my understanding?

    6.  Do I interrupt often?

    7.  Do I discount the speaker’s idea by immediately relating to my own
        experience?

    8.  Do I follow-up on a topic?

    9.  Do I use open ended questions without grilling the subject? ([novelty
        and curiosity
        play](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/IT-Agile-DevOps-CC/Playbooks/blob/master/AgilePlaybook/Building_a_team/My%20Mindset/novelty_curosity.md)
        may be useful here)

    10. Do I feel the need to fill silence?

    11. Do I wait till any emotion is drained before offering solutions?

4.  Discuss your responses with your colleague/peer. What does your colleague
    think of your listening style? Do they think it’s an accurate depiction and
    why or why not?

5.  Define what areas that you would like to work on specifically and document
    and share with your peer. Are there specific actions you can check in to
    hold each other accountable in the future? Are there appointments you can
    set to encourage each other? Should you set a reminder to send a note of
    encouragement? Figure out a strategy based on your intrinsic and extrinsic
    motivations to keep you in the growth mindset, and have your peer or manager
    support you in these areas.

    In addition, here are some tips to increase [active and empathetic
    listening](https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/empathic_listening)
    from Madelyn Burley-Allen (former president of the American listening
    association):

    1.  Be attentive. Be interested. Be alert and not distracted. Create a
        positive atmosphere through nonverbal behavior.

    2.  Be a sounding board -- allow the speaker to bounce ideas and feelings
        off you while assuming a nonjudgmental, non-critical manner.

    3.  Don't ask a lot of questions. They can give the impression you are
        "grilling" the speaker.

    4.  Act like a mirror -- reflect back what you think the speaker is saying
        and feeling.

    5.  Don't discount the speaker's feelings by using stock phrases like "It's
        not that bad," or "You'll feel better tomorrow."

    6.  Don't let the speaker "hook" you. This can happen if you get angry or
        upset, allow yourself to get involved in an argument, or pass judgment
        on the other person.

    7.  Indicate you are listening by

    8.  Providing brief, noncommittal acknowledging responses, e.g., "Uh-huh,"
        "I see."

    9.  Giving nonverbal acknowledgements, e.g., head nodding, facial
        expressions matching the speaker, open and relaxed body expression, eye
        contact. (without "overdoing it"

    10. Invitations to say more, e.g., "Tell me about it," "I'd like to hear
        about that," "say more about that."

    11. Follow good listening "ground rules:"

    12. Don't interrupt.

    13. Don't change the subject or move in a new direction.

    14. Don't rehearse in your own head.

    15. Don't interrogate.

    16. Don't teach.

    17. Don't give advice.

    18. Do reflect back to the speaker what you understand and how you think the
        speaker feels.
