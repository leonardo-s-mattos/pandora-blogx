Play : Building a high-performing team: Measuring Happiness
===========================================================

What is it:
-----------

Measuring team happiness and knowing when to course correct and what tp correct 
is easy when it is based off the team’s sentiment. This is extremely useful for 
maintaining a high-performing team. While SAP engages in an annual employee engagement 
survey, using a frequent sentiment analysis helps the team learn, supports their work 
efforts and allows them to collaborate with each other on a more personal basis. One way 
to do this is to use the niko-niko board, which explicitly makes people’s sentiments visible 
as an information radiator, and can trigger supportive action.

>   that long-lived Product teams learn as they grow over a longer period of
>   time….

>   Language: Niko-Niko roughly translates to the “smiley” emoticon in Japanese.

When to use it:
---------------

-   Hiring or Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Building and maintain
    this happiness maps helps build the trust and team cohesion.

-   Stable team not currently tracking happiness. Applying this play gives a
    happiness indicator and a trend to follow and act on.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   A team using the niko-niko as an information raditator.

-   A team using the niko-niko board understands the team sentiment on a
    frequently basis (e.g. daily).

-   A team using the niko-niko board takes corrective actions on a trend in
    sentiment.

>   Pro tip: A niko niko board should NOT be the only source of tracking
>   happiness. E.g. social cues, body language, the engagement survey, etc, all
>   can provide additional information.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Recommend Initial Time: 5-minute board setup and explanation to the team.

-   Recommended update: Daily. If the trend is down for a few weeks, it should
    be discussed (perhaps in the retro).

-   Difficulty level: 1/5

### Niko Niko play

1.  Find a visible place to display a Niko-Niko board. A
    [sample](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/nikoniko/) can be seen here.
    This can be done on a white-board, or for teams that are remote, Mural can
    work and there is an option for a slack plug in (which hasn’t been tested by
    us and has a cost beyond the basic version). I have not been able to find a
    plug in for Microsoft teams, but if you have, let me know.

-   Pro tip: To get actual use, a niko niko board should be so visible that the
    team literally sees it everyday. We included one on our Kanban board, but
    this may not be feasible. Embed it so it’s part of everyone’s daily route.

1.  On the niko-niko board, the names should be rows, and the days of the week
    should be the column, and each day, an emoticon should be used to denote the
    sentiment for the individual.

1.  Members on the team may establish behaviors like checking in with team
    members on bad days. If the team notices a significant downtrend in
    sentiment (over a few weeks), it should trigger some discussions on the root
    cause. One way is for the scrum master to facilitate this is in the sprint
    retro (both the review of the sentiment and any corrective actions).
