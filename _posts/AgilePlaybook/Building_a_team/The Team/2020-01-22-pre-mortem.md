Play : Building a high-performing team: Pre-mortem
==================================================

What is it:
-----------

Most teams are familiar with a post-mortem, or the technique of conducting
lessons learned at the end of a project or major initiative. A post-mortem is a
good way to dissect what has transpired. However, what if you are about to
embark on a large journey? Is there a way to harness the collective intelligence
to avoid the “death” of the project and expensive failures?

If you haven’t tried it before, a pre-mortem is a technique to avoid big risks
and understand the various hot button items for a team. It's a way for the
team within a project/organization to **imagine** that their project has failed and try
to figure out what the reason was for the failure. Unlike a post-mortem where you try to understand what
went wrong, in a pre-mortem you start from the failing point going backward in a predictive manner. It also helps the team feel valued for their input into planning and encourages honest discussions and transparency.

When to use it:
---------------

-   In a complex environment with many stakeholders of various opinions, such as
    during a program kick-off or a new unexplored area

-   If there is no common understanding within the team towards a complex goal

-   If you are struggling with fast delivery

-   If your plan is lacking

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   You have a clear vision on the main risks that you might face in the future
    by harnessing collective experience. 

-   Mitigation steps can be taken to reduce the identified risks

-   Team communicates risks in a more collaborative fashion and becomes more
    aligned in solving group problems.

-   The team takes actions to avoid future risks.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Pre-requisite: To start this play, ask your team members to step out from
    their actual roles and daily job. Let everyone think about all possible
    risks so everyone is prepared and can be part of the play.

-   Recommended time: 60 - 90 min

-   Difficulty level: 2/5

### Running the play

Warm Up: explain the exercise and the goals of predictive risk discovery which
will take place over the the next 60 - 90 min.

1.  The facilitator starts out with this statement. “XYZ effort has failed, and
    not just failed but failed spectacularly.” Let’s brainstorm on the reasons
    why this might happen before it actually does. The team will start to
    brainstorm all paths that could lead to failures. These can be written down
    and captured on a white-board via post-its or in Mural. Some other ways of
    phrasing the questions include:

    1.  What were the bad signs you ignored?

    2.  What concepts or ideas were we wrong about and led to unexpected failure.

    3.  Write down a failing story and don't be embarrassed by sharing that and
        encourage others to do the same. Be open about your weaknesses.

2.  Now summarize the ideas and get together in a discussion. Each member now
    has the possibility to challenge the other colleagues by asking why / what
    questions about the causes and outcomes. After that discussion, take a
    deeper look on the outcomes and think if there are other uncovered themes
    and risks that were previously undiscussed.

3.  Collect the most important three topics / risks. Each member of the team has
    three votes and can use them as they want, they could be given for one topic / risk
    or can be differently distributed. Always keep in mind to focus on the problems
    that can be fixed / influenced, however you still can go to those
    problems that are not under your control.

4.  Plan: It's time now to solve some problems. Get the team, and start looking into the top 
    voted opportunities as well as the top voted risks. That being done, a plan now is required
    for preventing the risks and snatch the opportunities for success. In the
    mean time you must keep an eye on how communication is doing between the
    team.

5.  These items can be brought into the working agreements.
