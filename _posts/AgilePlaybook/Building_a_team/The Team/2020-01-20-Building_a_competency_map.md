Play : Building a high-performing team: Team Competency Map
===========================================================

What is it:
-----------

A team competency map details the various skillsets or competencies of the team,
and highlights strengths and areas of growth in a visible, friendly artifact
that can lead to increased learning. It is also extremely useful for removing
unconscious biases when adding new members to the team. This is done by hiring for specific
needed skillsets via heat-mapping, by identifying skill gaps of broad-skilled
feature teams, and for enhancing personal (and consequently team) development
plans. It is also used for creating a structure to achieve cross-functional
“T Shaped” skillsets that agile teams require. Note: For purposes of this
exercise, skill, skillset and competency are used interchangeably.

>   Pro tip: One of the key differences in Product Teams versus Project teams is
>   that long-lived Product teams learn as they grow over a longer period of
>   time….

When to use it:
---------------

-   Hiring or Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Building and maintaining
    this competency map from the beginning helps select the right team members,
    or helps new teams understand which of their fellow team members can help them 
    develop specific skills they need to contribute to the teams' success.
    It also provides a starting point for learning opportunities between team members 
    and sets the stage for collaborative learning and a culture of openness.

-   Stable team looking to take on a new technology with newly required skills.
    Applying this play gives a roadmap for closing a skill gap.

-   Stable team in the process of hiring/selecting a new team member.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   A team using the competency map will know which skills are critical to
    delivering on their commitments.

-   A team using the competency map will be able to identify other members on
    the team who can teach them skills and fosters an environment when people
    have the opportunity to both teach and learn.

-   A member of the team can use the map to understand critical skillsets to
    develop.

-   A team using the competency map knows the type of skills desired when adding
    a new team member.

>   Pro tip: A team competency map should NOT be used to simply allocate or
>   delegate work to the experts, as this will often create a bottleneck and
>   avoid the opportunity for the team to learn together.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Recommend Initial Time: 30-minute initial discussion.

-   Recommended update: Ad-hoc, such as when a member achieves a new level
    (which should be celebrated by the group), a new skill is needed, or a new
    team member is added.

-   Difficulty level: 2/5

### Team competency map play

1.  In the group brainstorming session, team should brainstorm all the required
    skillsets. An application like Mural is recommended, where everyone can add
    post-it notes of the required skillsets for their committed work. If the
    team is stuck on where to start, it often helps to start at the end-product
    and work through the steps backwards, underscoring the skillset or
    competency needed to achieve that portion of the process. Also note, that
    team competency maps should not just include the technical skillsets, but
    should also include other soft skills that are required to keep your team
    happy and productive. For example, if Barbara is the best party planner ever
    (and she pretty much is), go ahead and throw that on there. It’s also best
    to avoid specific “roles” as competencies, e.g. developer, tester, scrum
    master, and instead put competencies like, java, automated testing in UI via
    selenium, or Scrum.

2.  Next affinitize, discuss, group and transfer the finalized skillsets into a
    table (such as excel) as rows. It can also help to group skills into larger
    themes, such as “technical skills”, “business skills”, etc… For the columns,
    put each team member’s name into a different column. One fun way to do this
    is have other people draw your face and see if they can recognize it (maybe
    not).

3.  Each person must then self-assess across each skillset from None to Expert.

-   **Expert**: I can teach it. (3) (Green)

-   **Practitioner**: I can do it. (2) (Yellow)

-   **Novice**: I’ve heard of it. (1) (Red)

-   **None**: What is it? (0)

1.  After completion the team should review it, and save it in a common and
    visible location. If you use numbers for the level and excel, you can also
    use the teams sum and conditional formatting to create an easy to see
    heat-map showing strengths and deficiencies of the team.

Here is a sample:

#### How to use for development planning

1.  After the map is completed, it’s recommended to be used anytime a member
    needs to learn a new skill by identifying an expert on the team and asking
    for help. While there are many ways for the member to acquire the skill from
    the expert, one play that can be used is a pair programming technique. See
    the pair programming play for more details. Other methods could be chalk
    talks, quick demos, creating a joint training together, etc.

2.  The team can also use the competency map to discuss how training efforts
    should be focused. For example, if building a Jenkins pipeline is a critical
    skillset, but no one has that the expertise, the group can tackle how they
    want to upskill (perhaps via an outside expert), and update their personal
    development maps accordingly to close that competency gap.

3.  Individual members can highlight the skills they would like to develop (e.g.
    simply by drawing a box, coloring a few squares differently) thus making
    them transparent to the team and creating additional teaching/learning
    opportunities.

#### How to use for hiring/adding a team member

One of the most persistent problems in the tech industry is hiring for diversity
and inclusion. One of the top tactics to battle the historical numbers is to
remove unconscious bias from selection process and understand how an
individual’s diverse competencies and experiences improve the team overall. The
team competency map provides a means to support you in this process.

One way to use the team competency map is to build a self-assessment form that
is based on the same skillsets the team uses. Typically, this would be in a
written fashion, and returned to the team before the interview process. During
the interview process, the candidate can explain their self-assessment, and that
can be used to derive the candidates various experience level relative to the
team as well as level-set their self-assessment against the rest of the
candidates own assessments. After building this profile of each candidate, the
team can then also do comparisons and scenarios about how that candidate would
improve the overall team skillset, and weigh the overall skills that the
candidate brings to the team.
