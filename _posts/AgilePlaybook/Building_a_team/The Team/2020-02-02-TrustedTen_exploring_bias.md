Play : Building a high-performing team: Trusted Ten – Exploring and finding bias
================================================================================

What is it:
-----------

Diversity can bring many benefits to a team including new ideas, higher team performance, and
varied perspectives. However, a key barrier to creating a more diverse team is
understanding our own unconscious biaes when hiring, selecting and partnering with new team
members. Actively using this play will help team members understand their biases and present 
the opportunity to discuss ways to mitigate this particular challenge.

>   Pro tip: One of the key differences in Product Teams versus Project teams is
>   that long-lived Product teams learn as they grow over a longer period of
>   time….

When to use it:
---------------

-   This play works well with the parallel play of the [team competency
    map](./2020-01-20-Building_a_competency_map.md)
    when hiring.

-   Hiring or Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Conducting this
    exercise helps highlight unconscious biases that exist within the team.

-   Stable team looking to increase its diversity during the hiring/selection
    process.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   A team using the trusted ten understands its biases and can be mindful of
    them when hiring or selecting for diversity.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Recommend Time: 30 minute team exercise.

-   Difficulty level: 1/5

### Ten Trusted play

1.  Open the [trusted ten
    PowerPoint](./Trusted_ten_clean.pptx)
    as an individual but stop at slide 3.

2.  Review the definitions of trust, this goes beyond familiarity. One easy
    question is to who would you call to help your move or make a major life
    decision? They are likely trusted.

3.  Write down 10 people you trust – trying as much as possible not to include
    family on your list. You may keep these names private if you prefer.

4.  **Do not open the powerpoint until you have written down the ten trusted
    people!**

5.  Proceed to slide 5, and for the ten people you have chosen, add in the
    diversity dimensions.

6.  On an individual level, review the dimensions for likeness to you.

7.  As a group, ask if anyone wants to share any insights that they learned
    about themselves.

8.  Review slide 6 and 7 as a team, discuss biases. One action could be to try
    to select team members with a different background than the majority of the
    team (if the team is transparent about their biases).

9.  If there are any actions that the team would like to take, those can be
    added into the working agreement.
