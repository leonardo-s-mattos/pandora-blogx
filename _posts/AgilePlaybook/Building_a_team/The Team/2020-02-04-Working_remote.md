Play : Building a high-performing team: Working with a dispersed and remote team (non co-located)
=================================================================================================

What is it:
-----------

Working collaboratively with a remote team is one of the biggest challenges for
any agile team. When you add to that global time zones, meeting schedules, cultural practices
regional and local norms, there doesn't seem to be anything close to a panacea or 
silver bullet that solves for all of the issues with remote teams. We do however, strongly 
advocate for teams to be co-located as a unit working face2face as much as is possible. 
However, we also realize that this is not always possible. For example our own team,
(the ADCC), is globally dispersed. The tips and tricks that we have found to produce quality 
end results may be helpful, but nothing replaces true face to face time. For many teams the difference  
that makes them high performing is the ability to connect in person, a dificult thing to do when team
members are located globally.

When to use it:
---------------

-   Hiring or creating Newly formed teams with remote workers (Storming/Forming stages).
    ...and building and maintaining happiness may create trust and team
    cohesion, however, and again, this is not ideal or recommended, so if you are building a new team,
    it’s preferred that it be co-located.

-   Stable team working to improve global alignment, or working with other teams
    that have dependencies.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   A team using the this play will arrive at a stable state of global
    collaboration and increased alignment.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Recommend Time: As appropriate. It will often take a variety of experiments
    before the team finds their own balance.

-   Recommended update: As appropriate.

-   Difficulty level: 5/5 (to truly work well without burnout)

### Remote team play

With a remote team, as mentioned there is not a single set of actions you can
take to get a globally team aligned easily. Below are some techniques that can
be tried. The key principles should attempt to include:

-   Alignment of the team towards the same goal (e.g. not a bunch of individuals
    working on assigned tasks).

-   Ensuring high-levels of information flow, especially serendipitous
    connections

-   Real connections, where people have the opportunity to build trust and avoid
    the 5 dysfunctions.

-   Avoiding burnout, through sharing the burden of pain.

-   Awareness of fault lines and remote workers (e.g. if the majority of the
    team is co-located with a few that are always dialing in)

-   Respect and empathy for the individuals on the team.

**Here are some tactics that can be experimented with to see if they work for
your team:**

1.  Avoid sending emails to individuals on the team unless necessary. Use
    “broadcast” methods, such as posting into a shared team slack or teams
    channel so that everyone can see or refer to.

2.  Use information radiators such as Kanban boards, Mural, [Niko-Niko happiness
    boards,](./2020-01-23-Team_Happiness_nikoniko.md)
    etc to stay aligned. Too much transparency and over-sharing information
    aren’t really a concern with dispersed teams.

3.  Use global collaboration tools as much as possible. Mural, Skype, Zoom,
    Slack, Teams are all useful in the right situation.

4.  Communicate in code – for development teams, clean code, behavior driven
    design, test driven design and higher automated test coverage can provide
    another way of collaboration. Modular design with defined end-points is
    preferred here.

5.  Try not to bottleneck on skillsets in certain timezones. Using the
    [competency
    map](./2020-01-20-Building_a_competency_map.md)
    with a regional dimension may help. Try to get as broadly skilled as
    possible to avoid wait time or lag times due to time zones.

6.  Maintain visible and public contact lists. Use a service like pager duty for
    scheduling if needed.

7.  Have rolling check-ins, e.g. APJ checks in with WDF at the end of their day,
    who then checks in with North America, and the end of the WDF day.

8.  Run health checks and team culture surveys more frequently.

9.  Invest more time into [working
    agreements](./2020-02-03-workingagreements.md).

10. Understand delegation and empowerment boundaries via [poker
    delegation.](./2020-01-21-poker_delegation_and_empowerment.md)

11. Share the burden of time-zones (e.g. shift painful meetings every other
    week)

12. Have a working agreement for video on during meetings unless outside normal
    working hours.

13. Acknowledge people when they sacrifice their time outside of their normal
    working hours.

14. When there are team meetings, but only a few remote workers, practice having
    everyone meet on their video chats so everyone is on an equal playing field
    during a call.

15. Remember to call on people not in the room during conference calls to get
    their opinion. (Out of sight often means out of mind)

16. If there is a physical celebration, try to make sure remote workers also
    have some way to participate.

17. Have virtual hangouts.
