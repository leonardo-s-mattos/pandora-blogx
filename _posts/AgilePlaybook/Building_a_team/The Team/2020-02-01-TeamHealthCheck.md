Play: Building a high-performing team: Health check
===================================================

What is it:
-----------

We also know that truly complex software cannot be built by a single individual, and can be extremely rewarding when the journey to solving a complex problem is shared with an engaged team. Humans are also typically wired to make connections and have social interactions; they tend to have higher happiness quotients when experiencing significant social connections, but, what is it that truly makes a team a high-performing team? How do you know when this happens? In this play below, we’ll give you some plays for checking in on your team and for fixing team related problems. Ultimately, setting the foundation for a true highly performing team starts with the simple active concept of “teamwork”; that is with open, honest and supportive conversations.

>   that long-lived Product teams learn as they grow over a long period of
>   time….

When to use it:
---------------

-   Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Consistently applying these
    health checks from the beginning helps form transparent feedback loops on
    acceptable team behavior and culture.

-   Feature or Squad team in need of improvement with clear dysfunctions. Applying this
    play give an avenue for improvement discussions.

-   Team that has a lot of “I’s.” Applying these play helps provide open,
    transparent, and builds trust, which are key for aligning towards the team’s
    goal.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

A team that is using health checks effectively will exhibit the following
characteristics:

-   Members of the team approach all of their interactions with each other with
    **kindness, consideration, empathy and respect**.

-   Members of the team will exhibit a high degree of collaboration.

-   Members of the team will consistently use supportive confrontation
    techniques.

-   Members of the team will collaborate more closely and shower higher
    engagement.

-   Members of the team will not show typical team dysfunctions.

-   The team will consistently check-in on team health in a structured manner,
    and take actions towards improving the team’s health.

-   The team will be aligned towards their goals and achieve higher productivity
    and happiness.

>   sometimes with supportive confrontation is the basis for a connection. As

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Pre-requisite play: [Creating honest discussions and
    Supportive](../Interacting/2020-01-04-Creating_honest_discussions.md)
    confrontation (for the post discussions)

-   Parallel play: This play also works well with the [Team Culture Survey
    play](./2020-01-27-TeamCulture.md).

-   Recommend Initial Time: 30-minute initial discussion.

-   Recommended update: Quarterly to measure team health. Improvement efforts
    should be on-going.

-   Difficulty level: 2/5

### Team health check and dysfunctions play

Based on the work noted in the book [The Five dysfunctions of a
team](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/dysfunctions) , a team needs trust,
healthy conflict, commitment, accountability and attention to results to perform
at a high level.

<./Advantagethe_five_dysfuctions.pdf>

#### Dysfunctional characteristics

-   Dysfunction \#1: Absence of Trust. The fear of being vulnerable with team
    members prevents the building of trust within the team.

-   Dysfunction \#2: Fear of Conflict. The desire to preserve artificial harmony
    stifles the occurrence of productive ideological conflict.

-   Dysfunction \#3: Lack of Commitment. The lack of clarity or buy-in prevents
    team members from making decisions they will stick to.

-   Dysfunction \#4: Avoidance of Accountability. The need to avoid
    interpersonal discomfort prevents team members from holding one another
    accountable.

-   Dysfunction \#5: Inattention to Results. The pursuit of individual goals and
    personal status erodes the focus on collective success.

**High-performing characteristics**

1.  Instead of an absence of trust, members are comfortable asking for help,
    admitting mistakes and limitations and take risks offering feedback, Taps
    into one another's skills and experiences.

2.  Instead of a fear of conflict, members put critical topics on the table and
    have lively meetings.

3.  Instead of a lack of commitment, members avoid wasting time talking about
    the wrong issues and revisiting the same topics over and over again because
    of lack of buy-in.

4.  Instead of avoidance of accountability, members make higher quality
    decisions and accomplish more in less time and fewer resources.

5.  Instead of an inattention to results, members align the team around common
    objectives, and ultimately retain star employees.

**Running the Assessment:**

1.  Setup a meeting with the team to discuss the 5 dysfunctions. Show the chart
    and confirm team’s understanding. The survey and and 5 dysfunctions
    explanation can take \<30 minutes, however an extended discussion may take
    longer of root causes can go long, so a 60 min initial meeting is
    recommended. It’s also recommended that the team first be familiar with the
    supportive discussion play before discussing the results.

2.  It’s recommended you save to a shared folder within the team, and everyone edits via excel
    online within the same file (each person chooses a separate column),
    however, this may also be done on paper and the facilitator can enter the
    data into the calculator at the end.

3.  Facilitator asks these questions out loud, and team marks a 1,2, or 3 in the
    excel file within their column. 1 = Rarely, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Always. If
    you don’t want to use the excel for anonymous reasons, people can write down
    their own numbers on a piece of paper, and the facilitator can manually
    enter them into the sheet.

1.  Once the data is entered into excel, the calculator will returns with
    highlighted problem areas like this sample:

| **Team Score:**                 | **Sum of Scores:** | **Advice:**                            |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Absence of trust**            | **5.00**           | **Problem area that needs addressing** |
| **Fear of conflict**            | **8.50**           | Not likely a problem area              |
| **Lack of commitment**          | **8.17**           | Not likely a problem area              |
| **Avoidance of Accountability** | **7.50**           | **Could be a problem area**            |
| **Intention to results**        | **7.33**           | **Could be a problem area**            |

2.  Based on the team score, problem areas should be discussed. To have a
    healthy discussion, it’s recommended that the team reviews the supportive
    confrontation play first. A few formats can be used to better facilitate
    good ideas including:

    1.  Retrospective format

    2.  Lessons Learned format

    3.  Faciliated Brainstorming format

3.  During these discussions, a few critical thinking techniques could be used
    including:

    1.  [Fishbone diagram (Cause and
        effect)](https://asq.org/quality-resources/fishbone)

    2.  [5
        whys](https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys/)

4.  Solutions should be put into action by the team and can be incorporated into
    your working agreement. Here are some suggestions if your team needs some
    basic solutions:

    1.  **Lack of Trust:**

        -   Icebreakers,

        -   Experiential Team building exercise (such as Escape rooms),

        -   Group Hackathons,

        -   Personality and Behavioral sharing (e.g. take the Myers-Briggs
            together and share),

        -   Describing and relating personal histories/hobbies/etc.

        -   Team dinners/team lunches.

        -   Hanging out and build something together.

        -   Engage in Storytelling sessions.

    2.  **Fear of conflict:**

        -   Role-play supportive confrontation.

        -   Designate a person to be the role of “miner” of conflict for a given
            period of time/meeting. The sole goal of that person is to bring out
            folks who aren’t contributing.

        -   Designate a person to be “devil’s advocate” for a given period of
            time/meeting.

        -   Encourage and support dissenting ideas, e.g. when responding to a
            conflicting idea, first repeat the idea, acknowledge that it might
            be valid, and then proposal your rebuttal if you have one.

        -   Acknowledge that when the discussion becomes uncomfortable (as long
            as it’s supportive), interrupt and remind this is necessary.

    3.  **Lack of Commitment:**

        -   Review the goals before each meeting. Clarify the goals frequently
            and often.

        -   Explicitly denote when there is a conflict and move to resolution.
            Ensure that everyone’s opinions have been heard, and confirm
            verbally when a decision is made, and don’t let it linger to the
            next meeting. In the meeting wrap-up, write out a decision log, and
            confirm in meeting minutes that despite contention, what is the
            agreed path forward.

        -   Ensure clear deadlines on decision making.

        -   If a decision is difficult to make, Explore alternate realities,
            e.g. what would happen if we do nothing. Also consider smaller
            experiments that can be validated to produce more information before
            a decision has to be made. What can we do to commit as late as
            possible, but increment as much as possible?

        -   Remember that failure earlier is acceptable, and failure is the
            team’s failure versus an individuals.

    4.  **Avoidance of Accountability:**

        -   Ensure clear definitions in the working agreement of what is
            acceptable behavior and unacceptable behavior, and what happens when
            something is violated. E.g. what is the team going to do about it?

        -   Role play and have the team practice holding each other accountable.

        -   Provide ongoing feedback reviews [(using supportive confrontation
            play).](../Interacting/2020-01-04-Creating_honest_discussions.md)

        -   Align team rewards to value peer accountability and team achievement
            vs. individual achievement. (No Heros!)

    5.  **Inattention to results:**

        -   Focus on the collective goals of the team versus individual success.

        -   Commit publicly to goals, and rewards aligned to achieving goals.
