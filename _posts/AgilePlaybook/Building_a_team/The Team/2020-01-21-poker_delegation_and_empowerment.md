Play : Building a high-performing team: Empowerment and Poker delegation
========================================================================

What is it:
-----------

Agile and management 3.0 talk about empowering a team, however many teams have
problems applying this concept in the real world. The Poker delegation play,
based off of the technique found in [management
3.0](https://management30.com/practice/delegation-poker/) helps a team be
explicit about defining and applying empowerment. It can be used successfully to
broker a conversation between any authority and a team.

>   Pro tip: One of the key differences in Product Teams versus Project teams is
>   that long-lived Product teams learn as they grow over a longer period of
>   time….

When to use it:
---------------

-   Hiring or Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Use this to define
    the boundaries of authority or have a conversation about levels of trust.

-   Stable team with unknown empowerment boundaries.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   An authority and team using the poker delegation to map out delegation
    boundaries.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Pre-read for team at: <https://management30.com/practice/delegation-poker/>

-   Recommend Initial Time: 30 minute discussion for \~5 representative
    scenarios (key decisions).

-   Recommended update: Ad-hoc, results can be incorporated into the working
    agreement.

-   Difficulty level: 2/5

Quick summary:

Delegation comes in various shades as is not binary. Create cards for each team
member, determine decision scenarios, play “poker” by each member choosing the
right level of delegation for that scenario and then determining consensus.

1.  Create cards numbered from 1 (Do exactly what I say) to 7 (Whatever you want
    is fine), with various steps in-between as seen on the management 3.0 site.
    The site has a printable version of the cards. Each team member should have
    a full set of cards.

2.  Define, clarify and list the various key decision scenarios.

3.  At the same time, each team member (including the authority figure), shows
    the delegation card. The highest and lowest cards speak. Form a consensus
    and attempt to allow more delegation than not. Checkout the website for
    other potential rules such as the rule of highest minority if needed.

4.  Document the scenarios within the working agreement. If a scenario comes up
    where the authority has delegated too much or little, revisit that decision.
