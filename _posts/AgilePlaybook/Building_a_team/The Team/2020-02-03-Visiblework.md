Play: Building a high-performing team: Making work visible and information radiators
====================================================================================

What is it:
-----------

Agile and high-performing teams often talk about how transparency is a key
foundational element to align their teams; how they build trust with customers, 
and how they hold each other accountable. One manifestation of this is in the 
typical scrum events, such as the daily stand-up, planning, review and retro 
sessions. These are however, mostly what we call a “push” style of communication
that requires the team to correctly identify which recipients and what information
is relevant. A “pull” or more self-service channel is an integral part of transparency,
as it can unlock new insight, new questions, and doesn’t require the team to immediately
know the who/what/when of a targeted communication. Instead, in a “pull” style
communication, information is broadcasted over a very public channel to any and
all members or participants. One typical artifact that demonstrates this is a Kanban board.
Any type of “information radiator”, such as a dashboard that shows the product health in
a common area, a niko-niko happiness chart for the team, or other up-to-date
broadcasts of information that are visible to all can support creating transparency
in a team. Also it can help keep the team aligned and learning towards a goal of
continuous improvement.

When to use it:
---------------

-   At all times with all teams, in all stages of capability and maturity
    levels.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   A team successfully using information radiators and other ways of making
    work visible creates a culture of openness and transparency.

>   Pro tip: There is no one correct channel to share information, but as
>   mis-alignments often occur, try to over communicate and experiment with
>   various techniques.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   Recommend Time: 60-minute initial session to identify key types of
    information.

-   Recommended update: As often as possible.

-   Difficulty level: 3/5

### Making Work Visible

As mentioned before, making work visible is a key way to radiate information.
When done well, it can spurn new innovations, point out problems quickly, and
align teams with their stakeholders. That said, we already live in a world
where we are bombarded with TOO much information, and so striking the balance of
information that is relevant and needed must be weighed. The play below can be
used to determine what information is relevant, and who as well as where to broadcast it.

**Here are three characteristics of viable and sustainable information
radiators:**

1.  Information radiators amplify feedback loops and answers a question that
    everyone would like to know the answer. It can also triggers an action.
    (E.g. you learn something or do something as a result of seeing the
    information).

2.  Radiators should be easy to read and easy to update. Also, an information
    radiator is something the “radiates” frequently enough that people want to
    look at it. (If it’s too complicated or it takes too long to update, it’s
    not going to get updated or read).

3.  Do Project Managers love it? If so, great, kill it because no one else finds
    it useful. Joking aside, the question is if the data is removed a step or
    two from the source, and requires additional cleansing, euphemizing key
    communication points, and isn’t simple enough to be understood in 10 secs or
    less it most likely has lost its ability to radiate. If it is buffered, it’s 
    likely not a true information radiator.

**Some typical examples of information radiators for agile teams:**

-   Kanban board to manage WIP

-   Product backlog

-   Value stream map highlighting bottleneck/constraints

-   Team Happiness as expressed in the [niko-niko
    play](./2020-01-23-Team_Happiness_nikoniko.md)

-   Delivery pipeline health/state and results

-   Automated Testing results

-   Product health and Monitoring alerts

>   **The play:**

1.  Facilitate a session with the key team and some stakeholders. Whether this
    is done in a joint brainstorming session, or via a small set of selected
    interviews with the team and stakeholders is up to what works for the team.

2.  Develop a set of “personas” (or re-use existing stakeholder and team
    personas) that you already have for your team.

3.  Gather key data points from the persona’s viewpoints that help the team
    understand what transparency is needed, including the typical, Who, What,
    Where, Why, When and How. Some typical examples could be:

    1.  Transparency into the team/product’s priority. Transparency into what
        the focus areas are over a roadmap or similar future vision.

    2.  Transparency into the teams work in progress, and what the bottleneck
        is.

    3.  Transparency into where work is coming from (e.g. unplanned vs planned,
        etc)

    4.  Transparency into progress on current sprint (e.g. burn-down/burn-up
        chart)

    5.  Transparency into dependencies.

    6.  Transparency into key metrics that the team uses to measure itself.

    7.  Transparency into key build/test/delivery states (continuous
        integration/continuous delivery metrics)

    8.  Transparency into working software (recorded demos, etc)

    9.  Transparency into which features are on, which features are off
        (blue/green or A/B scenarios)

    10. Transparency into team/product’s health.

    11. Transparency into system performance, incidents, alerts, etc.

    12. Transparency into key decisions, architecture, etc.

    13. Systems model of how the team’s strategy is impacted by its operational
        model.

    14. Transparency into team’s happiness.

    15. Transparency into failures (root causes) and the team’s reaction to
        those.

    16. Transparency into experiments that the team took (successful or not)

    17. Transparency into learning activities that the team is attempting.

    18. When a team-member cannot be distracted (aka the don’t bother me light)

4.  Vote and decide on a few possible information radiators that your team would
    like to experiment with. It can be easier to experiment on paper or mural
    before you build a software tool/report to automate.

5.  Try experimenting with the radiator and check on the experiment after a few
    weeks. Ask these following questions:

    1.  Did it change any behavior or trigger any learning or actions?

    2.  Is it worth updating? Do we need to automate it?

At any time, we’d recommend that all teams have these information radiators:

1.  Product backlog

2.  Kanban board for Work in Progress

3.  Progress Towards sprint commitment

4.  Delivery pipeline state (health, etc)

5.  Product health
