Play : Building a high-performing team: Surveying Team Culture
==============================================================

What is it:
-----------

Many high-performing teams note that culture is the “secret sauce,” that allows 
them to be successful. However, describing and quantifying “culture” can seemingly
be a difficult task. However, thanks to scientific research by Ron Westrum in the area 
of team culture and function- there is real hope of discovering how a team can function 
best, especially in high risk environments (think NASA, medical devices, fighter jets, etc) 
and this work can easily be translated into non-risky environments as well and teams. Nicole Forsgren
in her work looking at the current State of DevOps and high performing orgs, shows us 
quantifiable ways of measuring team culture. In this play, you will uncover this 
technique for your own team.

>   that long-lived Product teams learn as they grow over a longer period of
>   time….

When to use it:
---------------

-   Newly formed team (Storming/Forming stages). Consistently applying this
    survey from the beginning helps form transparent feedback loops on
    acceptable team behavior and culture and helps measure team culture over
    time.

-   Managers and members of team curious about team culture score. Applying this play give an
    avenue for improvement discussions.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

A team that is using a team culture effectively will exhibit the following
characteristics: \* Members of the team understand key cultural drivers for
high-performance. \* Members of the team will exhibit a high degree of
collaboration and effectively share information. \* The team will be result and
performance oriented towards aligned goals, with high degrees of co-operation,
shared risks, trained messengers, bridging encouraged, failure leading to
inquiry, and novelty implemented. \* The team will be aligned towards their
goals and achieve higher productivity and happiness.

>   Pro tip: If you share information simply to cover your ass, you are NOT
>   working in a generative culture.

How to execute it:
------------------

-   **Team culture survey** play

-   Recommend Time: 30-minute initial discussion. (15 minutes to conduct survey,
    15 minutes to conduct retrospective discussion).

-   Recommended to repeat quarterly.

-   Difficulty level: 1/5

### Team culture survey play

1.  Ask these 9 questions on a scale of 1-5 (strongly disagree to strongly
    agree). After survey, average team score, compare and discuss.

-   1: *Cross functional collaboration is encouraging and rewarded.*

-   2: *Messengers are not punished when they deliver news of a failure.*

-   3: *Failure causes inquiry.*

-   4: *Responsibilities are shared.*

-   5: *Failures are treated primarily as opportunities to improve the system.*

-   6: *Innovative ideas are welcomed.*

-   7: *Information is actively sought, shared and accessible in an easy
    manner.*

-   8: *Everyone on my team has unlimited access to any of the metrics and
    system data (e.g. logs/dashboards) from the Dev/Test/Prod environments, and
    is used to adjust the development practice and priorities.*

-   9: *Within my organizational structure and operating mode, Development, QA,
    Operations, Security, QA are distinct and Independent.*

1.  Enter in data into Westrum Culture Score Calculator stored in this [folder -
    hit
    download](./Westrum%20Culture%20Score%20calculator.xlsx).
    Review tab “Team Culture Score”.

2.  Discuss questions and team averages, including questions 8 and 9.

3.  Conduct a retrospective on possible actions based off of the scores. 

4.  Choose 1 or 2 items to bring into your working agreement and see if it makes
    a difference! Come back and repeat the culture survey in another quarter.
