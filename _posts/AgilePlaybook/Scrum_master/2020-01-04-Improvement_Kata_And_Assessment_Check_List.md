Play: Improvement Kata with Agility Assessment for Scrum Masters
=========================================================

What is it:
-----------

The Scrum Masters position is a critical role for the ability of a software development team to constantly improve and better function. It is the Scrum Master’s responsibility to ensure the team is willing to experiment in all areas of development, testing and team responsibilities. This type of challenge and guidance allows the team to constantly improve. The checklist below is a quick and simple assessment tool to evaluate the agility state of the team being coached. It will help identify impediments and areas for improvement; this even includes improvements at an organizational level as well as how the enhancements impact the ability of the team and product owner to perform at their best.

The improvement kata can solve problems that typical retrospectives fail to address or even recognize. Although there is a halo of mystery around what this kata ritual is, it’s actually rather easy to get started! On your Mark, Ready? Here's your guide.

Here is a way to explain what the improvement kata is :

* It’s a continuous improvement technique. It relies on a scientific method to reach a target state.
* It involves running experiments to know if your ideas are valid.
* It can be lengthy to get through, but it works in tricky situations where retrospectives don’t work.
* It’s 100% scientific. It uses data analysis and deduction, not gut feeling and community best practices.
* It can be part of the backlog, as any other item. It does not have to be a special event like retrospectives usually are.

>Pro tip : Create a fixed time for improvement cycles - ideally no longer than 90 days - and at every iteration, use this checklist and document the experiments tried during that time as well as the expected impact on the team outcome. Use this as part of the next review.

When to use it:
---------------

-   Use "Improvement Kata" or cycle to drive the team's behavior

-   The checklist is a tool to be used at the end or beginning of each improvement cycle to guide the scrum master's actions so that the effort to identify the bigger impediments and areas of improvement remain the priority.

-   When stable teams have to take on new information and or learning.

-   To Review the working agreement with new team members.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

-   A list of identified impediments with the prioritized experiments with intention to remove them.

-   Empowerment to escalate organization issues, with data to support it.

-   Engagement of the team, including product owner, on the continuous improvement process with the realization of results.

-   Celebration and recognition of the improvements done over the time and highlight of the journey a 

How to execute it:
------------------

The nutshell of any cycle is that it starts from a known state, then there are events (in some cases actions or experiments) that lead to another state which in turn is usually the current state, and then closing the cycle ( or starting a new one :smiley: ). So always use the "Scrum Master checklist" as one tool to know the current state and how the experiments impacted the reality of the team.

To run the improvement kata, you need to constantly answer these 5 questions:
* What’s the target condition ? (Describe what are you trying to achieve)
* What’s the actual condition ? (Describe your current situation)
* What obstacles do you think are preventing you from reaching the target condition ? Which ones are you addressing now ? (Describe the first problem you are about to try to fix)
* What is your next step ? What do you expect ? (Describe the experiment you are going to run to test a solution)
* When can we go and see what we have learned from taking that step ? (Run the experiment and learn from the results. Decide on a process change or repeat from an earlier step)

Repeatedly ask yourself the coaching kata questions;  "Will this help me stay on track?"

Here is how to get started :

1) If its the first time you are doing the "Improvement Kata", you can **start by answering the assessment check list**. If you have done enough retros with the team or have administered an assessment you can use those results or the team's perception of blockers. Either way, the important first step is to pick a topic and try it on. Best candidates are clear and important problems.

2) Once you’ve identified a topic, **take ownership of the kata**. You can pair with some leader in the team as well. It’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to do the full kata in one afternoon. Understanding happens when the brain is at rest, and experiments take time. The owners need to dedicate some time to follow up on the kata. 

3) **Assess the current state of that topic and define experiments to try to solve the problems** you are foreseeing. Ultimately, you want to prevent it from hapening so the team performs its best. Log the expected result for the experiments and "how it should, could and might look if it were to work" (... it could be having a version of the checklist with the expected state at the end of the cycle.) **Define the time you would like to see those results.**

4) **Constant observe** how the team is doing on the experiment execution. Observe and take notes.

5) At the end of the defined time, **evaluate again the current scenario**, by answering the Scrum Master Checklist. And in the case where you have created an "expected one" compare them and take notes for future cycles. If not, just assess if the **actual outcome of the experiments matches what it was expected**.

6) Start over on step 2.


Going through the kata in pairs is a great way to spread the practice within the team. At some point you might be able to run many improvement katas in parallel ! "Just make sure not to walk on each other’s toes"…

Expect the first time to be a bit rocky, and you might feel lost from time to time. If this happens, stick to the actions and experiments defined with and by the team and remember that there aren't failed experiments, but experiments in which the outcome was not the expected. Just the simple act of experimenting and learning from it, is a great improvement if used in future tries.
