# Play : Mob Programming

## What is it:
Mob programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming, where two people collaborate and work at the same computer, but mob programming extends the collaboration to everyone on the team. It still uses a single computer for writing the code, but a projector shows everyone what’s on the screen.

On mob programming session, everyone works together to do almost all the work a typical software development team tackles, such as defining stories, designing, coding, testing, deploying software, and working with the customers or internal partners and business people, whom we also consider to be team members. We strive to accentuate and amplify concepts such as face-to-face and side-by-side communication, team alignment, collaboration, whole team involvement, continuous code review, and the "self-organizing team" concept, to name a few.

## When to use it:
This technique is mostly effective on initial stages of a new product or major architecture refactor. With this purpose, mob can be use for longer period of times in session  of half or full day, until product and or strategy is aligned and discovered by team. When that happen, and the team knows when, and its usually when team start to build out the product, the development effort is spread on pairs of team members

Use mob as well for major code review and knowledge sharing on exploring new technology or architecture.

Dont use Mob programming for longer periods of time. Mostly do it for one entire day, with suggestion to do for 4 hours to be more effective.


## Expected outcomes:
A team that is using Mob Programming effectively will exhibit the following characteristics:

* Members of the team approach all of their interactions with each other with **kindness, consideration, and respect**.
* The team’s **physical space** is set up such that the entire team can work on the same thing at the same time on the same computer without ergonomic issues.
* The team practices **single piece flow** by starting, working on, and delivering one work item before moving on to the next item.
* The team is always seeking to improve through **frequent retrospectives** matched up with concrete action items.

## How to execute it:

#### Basic Working Area

Most of the work is done sitting together in the group work area. Try to make it as comfortable as possible. There is plenty of room and can easily have others join us whenever needed.
Work area should be configured out of some standard cubicle walls. It works pretty nicely, although its suggested to work on a separate room to do the experience be even better if targeted for some design or product inception.

#### The computer

There is only one computer in use for programming. Also have other computers sitting around that its used while you are mobbing for researching, looking at databases, writing emails, etc. in parallel with the programming. There will often be more than one person searching for information about some problem or new technology you are trying to use. Stay all together and communicate continually about what you are learning.

#### Projectors

Setup must have 2 projectors or big monitors to be uses as dual monitors. Project onto a wall painted with a matte white paint that works well for this purpose. After experimenting with the height, distance, brightness, and other settings, found a basic setup that works nicely for everyone. 
It can be done with 2 big screens or tvs on a meeting room.

#### Keyboard/Mouse
There are two keyboards and two mice (ideally) so everyone has a choice that works for them. If not possible or not a dedicated mob space, it can be done with one mouse and keyboard. Hand sanitizer is always available.

#### Chairs and Tables
Use your “own chairs” which we move around as we take on the different roles (Driver or Navigator). This way you don’t need to constantly readjust the chairs.

The work surface must be a couple of tables that are comfortable to sit at. Put the computer, keyboards/mice, projectors, phone, speakers, and a few other things on the tables.

Have a rolling magnetic whiteboard for keeping track of the work we are doing, as well as a few other whiteboards and easels.

#### Driver/Navigator
Follow a “Driver/Navigator” style of work, which is originally from pair programming technique.

In this “Driver/Navigator” pattern, the Navigator is doing the thinking about the direction you want to go, and then verbally describes and discusses the next steps of what the code must do. The Driver is translating the spoken English into code. In other words, all code written goes from the brain and mouth of the Navigator through the ears and hands of the Driver into the computer. 

In use of this pattern, there is one Driver, and the rest of the team joins in as Navigators and Researchers. One important benefit is communicating and discussing you design to everyone on the team. Everyone stays involved and informed.

The main work is Navigators “thinking , describing, discussing, and steering” what you are designing/developing. The coding done by the Driver is simply the mechanics of getting actual code into the computer. The Driver is also often involved in the discussions, but main job is to translate the ideas into code. Of course, being great at writing code is important and useful – as well as knowing the languages, IDE and tools, etc. – but the real work of software development is the problem solving, not the typing.

If the Driver is not highly skilled, the rest of the team will help by guiding the Driver in how to create the code – we often suggest things like keyboard short-cuts, language features, Clean Code practices, etc.  This is a learning opportunity for the Driver, and we transfer knowledge quickly througout the team which quickly improves everyones coding skills.

#### Rotation
Rotate the Driver every 15 minutes. Using a list of who is working, “rotate” through the list – so every 15 minutes the current Driver moves away from the keyboard and joins the Navigators, and the next person on the list moves to the keyboard to start typing. As the day goes whenever we get to the bottom of the list we just start over again at the top.

#### Private working area
Have your own work areas to use whenever we need to. There are small desk areas in a separate annex to the Mob area and it’s also made from standard cubicle walls. These are configured as either sit-down or stand-up depending on what the individual prefers.  Each work area has a computer with dual monitors, drawers, phone, etc.
